= Graph Refactoring Procedures

These procedures help refactor the structure of your graph.
This is helpful when you need to change your data model or for cleaning up data that was imported from an external source.

== Merging Nodes

You can merge a list of nodes onto the first one in the list.

All relationships are merged onto that node too.
You can specify the merge behavior for properties globally and/or individually.

---
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH p ORDER BY p.created DESC // newest one first
WITH p.email, collect(p) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes, {properties: {name:'discard', age:'override', kids:'combine', `addr.*`, 'override',`.*`: 'discard'}}) YIELD node
RETURN node
---

This config option also works for `apoc.refactor.mergeRelationships([rels],{config})`.

[opts=header]
|===
| type | operations
| discard | the first nodes' property will remain if already set, otherwise the first property in list will be written
| override |Â last property in list wins
| combine | if there is only one property in list, it will be set / kept as single property otherwise create an array, tries to coerce values
|===

For mergeNodes you can Merge relationships with same type and direction, you can spacify this with property mergeRels.
Relationships properties are managed with the same nodes' method, if properties parameter isn't set relationships properties are combined.

.example1 - Relationships with same start and end nodes

First of all we have to create nodes and relationships

---
Create (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),
(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2018}]->(n3),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2004}]->(n7),
(n1)-[:DRIVE{since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS{since:2013}]->(n6)
return *;
---

image::{img}/apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.createDataSetFirstExample.png[]

Next step is calling the apoc to merge nodes :Person

---
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{properties:"combine", mergeRels:true}) yield node
MATCH (n)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(c) return *
---

and the result is:

image::{img}/apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultFirstExample.png[]

In this case we have relationships with same start and end nodes so relationships are merged into one and properties are combined.


.example2 - Relationships with different start or end nodes

---
Create (n1:Person {name:'Tom'}),
(n2:Person {name:'John'}),
(n3:Company {name:'Company1'}),
(n4:Company {name:'Company2'}),
(n5:Car {brand:'Ferrari'}),
(n6:Animal:Cat {name:'Derby'}),
(n7:City {name:'London'}),
(n8:City {name:'Liverpool'}),
(n1)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2015}]->(n3),
(n2)-[:WORKS_FOR{since:2018}]->(n4),
(n3)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2004}]->(n7),
(n4)-[:HAS_HQ{since:2007}]->(n8),
(n1)-[:DRIVE{since:2017}]->(n5),
(n2)-[:HAS{since:2013}]->(n6)
return *;
---

image::{img}/apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.createDataSetSecondExample.png[]

Next step is calling the apoc to merge nodes :Person

---
MATCH (a1:Person{name:'John'}), (a2:Person {name:'Tom'})
WITH head(collect([a1,a2])) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes,{properties:"combine", mergeRels:true}) yield node
MATCH (n)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(c) return n.name,r.since,c.name;
---

and the result is:

image::{img}/apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExample.png[]

image::{img}/apoc.refactor.mergeNodes.resultSecondExampleData.png[]

In this case we have relationships with different end nodes so all relationships are maintained and properties are combined into all relationships.


---
MATCH (p:Person)
WITH p ORDER BY p.created DESC // newest one first
WITH p.email, collect(p) as nodes
CALL apoc.refactor.mergeNodes(nodes, {properties:'combine', mergeRels: true}) YIELD node
RETURN node
---


== Normalize boolean properties

Given raw data boolean properties are often represented by placeholder values.
This procedure turns them into boolean properties.

Will be true if "Y", YES"; false if "N", "NO"; null otherwise:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(n, "prop", ["Y", "YES"], ["N", NO"])
RETURN n.prop
----

== Categorization

Categorize replaces string property values on nodes with relationship to a unique category node for that property value.

This example will turn all n.color properties into :HAS_ATTRIBUTE relationships to :Color nodes with a matching .colour property.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.refactor.categorize('color','HAS_ATTRIBUTE',true,'Color','colour',['popularity'],1)
----

Additionally, it will also copy over the first 'popularity' property value encountered on any node n for each newly created :Color node and remove any occurrences of that property value on nodes with the same 'Color'.

= Using Cypher and APOC to move a property value to a label

You can use the procedure link:#_creating_data[`apoc.create.addLabels`] to move a property to a label with Cypher as follows

.Create a node with property studio
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'A Few Good Men', genre: 'Drama'})
----

.Move the 'genre' property to a label and remove it as a property
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Movie) 
CALL apoc.create.addLabels( id(n), [ n.genre ] ) YIELD node 
REMOVE node.genre
RETURN node
----
