== UUID

There is the possibility to set uuid index property on nodes using APOC.

For doing this there are some configurations to set on `neo4j.conf`:

[cols="1m,5"]
|===
| apoc.uuid.enabled  | true/false     | enable uuid creation
| apoc.uuid.schedule | default 60s    | time in which statement is scheduled
| apoc.uuid.labels   | list of labels (separated by comma) | labels node where will be created the uuid index
